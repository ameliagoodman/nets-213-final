## Read the instructions before you start the HIT for our quality control purposes. 

## Demographic survey
Fill out the demographic survey according to your background: the country you live in, your gender, age, and ethnicity. 

## Ranking Qualities
This section tests how important intelligence, sense of humor, wealth, physical attractiveness, social status, health, emotional sensitivity, and affability is to different people. Rank these qualities on a scale from 1-7. However, be sure to rank how you personally would rate these qualities in addition to how the average person in your resident country would.
